# Machine-Learning-Classification-
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using multiple machine learning algorithms. The aim is to compare different supervised learning models and evaluate their performance to determine the most effective one for churn prediction.

## 🎯 Objective
1) Analyze telecom customer data to identify churn patterns.
2) Implement and compare multiple machine learning models.
3) Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
1) Programming Language: Python
2) Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn,Statsmodel
3) Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
Handled missing values and categorical encoding.
Feature scaling for numerical columns.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Visualized churn distribution.
Checked correlations between features.

3. **Model Building & Comparison**
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-Score
ROC-AUC Curve
Precision Recall Curve

## 📈 Key Insights
1. Random Forest outperformed other models in churn prediction.
2. Certain features (like tenure, monthly charges, contract type) strongly influenced churn.
3. Logistic Regression was interpretable but less accurate.
